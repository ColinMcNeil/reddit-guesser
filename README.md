# Reddit Guesser

Interactive web game, similar to geoguesser.

Users are given a random text post, article, or image on reddit, and must guess what subreddit it was found on.

To start in development mode:

```shell
npm start
```

Then go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You will see a simple page
that pre-renders and that is interactive on load. It also will include hot
reloading of React components in their own file.
